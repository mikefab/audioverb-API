walk on water
walk the line
walk the straight and narrow
walk the streets
walk the walk
wander down the primrose path
warm the bench
wash one's hands of
watch it
watch one's mouth
wear one's heart on one's sleeve
wear the pants
wear thin
weigh a ton
wet one's pants
whet one's whistle
whip into shape
whistle in the dark
win someone's trust
wing it
wipe off the books
work like a dog
work like a horse
work off one's tail
work one's tail off
work up a sweat
wrap one's head around
wrap one's mind around
write in blood
write in stone
write one's own ticket
zip it
